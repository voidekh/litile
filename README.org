#+title: LiTile

A little tiling script written in pure POSIX shell script. Supports multiple
horizontal displays of the same resolution.

Tested with Xfce, but should work with any floating WM.

** Dependencies
You need following commands available in your $PATH:
- awk
- xprop
- wmctrl
- xwininfo
- xdotool
- xrandr (optional)
- notify-send (optional)

** Usage

#+begin_src sh 
litile [-d=numberofdisplays] action
#+end_src

*** Available actions:
- tile - Tiles current display with master-stack layout, currently focused window being master
- monocle - Maximizes currently focused window, and also raises it (so it covers tiled ones)
- move-left - Moves window to left display
- move-right - Move window to right display
- prev - Focus and move cursor to previous window on the same workspace
- next - Focus and move cursor to next window on the same workspace
- display-prev - Move cursor to previous display
- display-next - Move cursor to next display
- select-window - Overview-like feature (show all windows on display, and select one with your mouse)
- re-init - Let LiTile count your displays again and cache in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/litile-init file

Defining number of displays in CLI or in ~/.config/litilerc takes precedence over
detected number of displays (which is done on first run after reboot and stored
in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/litile-init file.

** Caveats
- it assumes you have a top panel on every display
