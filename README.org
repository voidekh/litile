#+title: LiTile

A little tiling script written in pure bash. Supports multiple horizontal 
displays of the same resolution.

Tested with Xfce, but should work with any floating WM.

** Dependencies
You need following commands available in your $PATH:
- awk
- xprop
- wmctrl
- xwininfo
- xrandr (optional)
- notify-send (optional)

** Usage

#+begin_src sh 
litile [-d=numberofdisplays] action
#+end_src

*** Available actions:
- tile - Tiles current display with master-stack layout, currently focused window being master
- move-left - Moves window to left display
- move-right - Move window to right display

Defining number of displays in CLI or in ~/.config/litilerc makes it work faster.
Otherwise xrandr is called every time which is slow.

** Caveats
- it assumes you have a top panel on every display (might fix it)
- when tiling master window, top_bar value needs to be doubled for unknown reason
